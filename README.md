# ZombieSurvivial
I will try to make a Call Of Duty Zombie wave like game, on Unity in C#.

The Game Design Document :
The Book of needs :
The figma files :

The game concist of being a alone player on deserted map full of zombies. You will try to survivre buying guns and ammos, power ups and upgrades.
On each start waves zombies get more and more difficult to kill, but will give more and more money to buy things.

The score is counted by total money gain, total head shots, total zombies killed and max round survive. So how much gonna be your HighScore?
